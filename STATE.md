## Environment note
ALL charts are DEMO; multi-symbol attachments are test surface.
Checklist EVIDENCE comes from XAUUSD.s only.
Broker facts: Doo Prime XAUUSD.s stops level is DYNAMIC - 100 pts was a
sample observed at init; it has ranged ~20-100 pts within one evening.
Never treat it as a constant; guidance logs must say "at init".
DEPLOY NOTE (b24): no policy selector - manual exit adoption is live
behavior on EVERY chart b24 is attached to. Flagged and accepted.

## Verified (demo, logs audited)
Stages 1-7 SEALED (S7 sealed 2026-07-16 on b23; kill tests on b21).
Stage 8 Step 1 SEALED by Jeff 2026-07-20 on b28 (see seal section).
Stage 8 Step 2 (draggable lines) is the only parked Stage 8 item.
Stage 9 Step 1 SEALED by Jeff 2026-07-20 on b29 (tester interactive).
Stage 10 (observability batch) SEALED by Jeff 2026-07-21 at Stage10-b32.
A1 guards A/B/C, A2 (reworked b31), A3 (>0 branch), A4 all PASS with

Full scoreboard in HANDOVER_2026-07-21_stage10_b32.md.

## b33 changes (Stage 9 Step 2: tester pending-line NUDGE, matrix SEALED
## 2026-07-21). ZERO money paths (trade-primitive count 8=8 vs b32).
1. INPUT InpTesterNudgePts (default 50) + "=== Tester (Stage 9) ===" group.
   Global g_nudgePts clamped >=1 in OnInit (N1-5). LogTesterModeOnce now
   says "12 buttons" and announces the nudge step.
2. NEW FN NudgePendingLine(dir) [helper-before-caller, above
   HandlePanelClick]: moves ONLY PLINE OBJPROP_PRICE by +/- g_nudgePts;
   reads g_pendDir, never writes (N3-4); no-line -> INFO "no pending line
   to move" (N3-3, not silent). Free movement either side of market;
   CONFIRM stays sole authority (G4).
3. DISPATCH B_PUP/B_PDN in HandlePanelClick (reuse shared un-press +
   PanelRefresh). 
4. LAYOUT (placing branch): TESTER-only 4-button row CONFIRM|+|-|CANCEL
   via x-cursor; LIVE else-branch byte-identical (bw2+40 CONFIRM, N3-1).
   Nudge buttons collapse to 10x10 off when not placing, tester-guarded
   so the live panel never creates the objects.
5. POLL ARRAY 10 -> 12 (B_PUP/B_PDN appended last; up-before-dn = N1-4
   order); loop bound now ArraySize (no second magic number). Existing 10
   dispatch order + behavior unchanged.
No persisted field added (state schema/self-test unchanged, N4-2). Line
delta +60 (est. was +40; tester layout split + comments ran longer).
STATUS: SEALED by Jeff 2026-07-21. All 20 checklist items resolved
(12 PASS audited, S13/S14 equivalence, S15/S17/S19/S20 inspection).
S1 full lifecycle recomputed exact to the cent; money engines proven
byte-identical to b32. No FAILs, no new parked items.

## b32 changes (Stage 10: A5 reword, 2026-07-21)
Finding (evidence: every reason-5 deinit this session -> "acquired (no
existing lock)"): OnDeinit calls ReleaseInstanceLock() UNCONDITIONALLY,
so a clean re-init (param change, recompile) releases the lock and the
next init logs "acquired", NOT "re-asserted". The re-assert branch
(owner==ChartID + fresh heartbeat + lock present) is therefore only
reachable via an UNCLEAN shutdown that skips OnDeinit. b29's and b31's
"parameter-change re-init" descriptor named an unreachable case.
FIX (wording only, line count unchanged): re-assert message now names
ONLY the unclean-shutdown-survivor case and notes a clean re-init
releases the lock first. A5 accepted by INSPECTION: trigger branch
byte-identical to b29, string-only change, and forcing a hard-kill +
fast-restart purely to watch a wording line is disproportionate.

## b31 changes (Stage 10: A2 REWORK after live FAIL, 2026-07-21)
Live verification found A2-as-b30 broken two ways (evidence retained):
- S10-11 FAIL: init sibling never fires - MQL_TRADE_ALLOWED reads TRUE at
  OnInit even with F7 "Allow Algo Trading" unchecked (12:45 init silent,
  12:46 send blocked "by client"). Flag does not track the checkbox at
  init on this MT5 build.
- TP4 (flag-aware 10027) was on the PENDING path only; the common
  MARKET-entry path (E7) printed MT's generic string, no cause hint
  (12:46 BUY 10027). BUT the flag IS correct at TRADE time: 12:55 pending
  10027 with box off printed the EA-checkbox branch = S10-15 PASS.
b31 fix (ZERO money paths, +8 lines 4228->4236):
1. Removed the dead init sibling (TP3). Toolbar-off at init still covered
   by the existing WARN.
2. New helper AutoTradingDisabledHint() - single source for the 3-branch
   10027 cause hint, called at SEND time only (flag reliable there).
3. E7 (market entry) now appends the hint on 10027 (was bare).
4. P6 (pending) now calls the helper (+ keeps "Distance was fine.") -
   no duplicated branch logic to drift.

## b30 changes (Stage 10: observability batch, matrix SEALED 2026-07-21)
Design: STAGE10_MATRIX.md (20 rows) + STAGE10_PLAN.md (7 touch points).
ZERO money paths - emission/wording only. +31 lines (4197 -> 4228).
Compile is gate zero (Jeff's terminal); not yet compiled.
1. A1 (M1): Guards A/B/C blocked-while-flat now FILE-log a WARN, not
   dashboard-only. Reason-tracked via transient g_flatBlockReasonLogged
   (0/1/2/3): one WARN per reason, re-announce on reason switch, re-arm
   on clear or when a sequence opens. reasonNow set only in the flat
   branch => never fires while a sequence is live (M1-7). Closes the
   Inputs-Reset silent path that bit Jeff (Guard A blocked, no journal).
2. A2 (M2): per-EA MQL_TRADE_ALLOWED now checked. Init sibling WARN
   (gated toolbar-ON && program-OFF, no double-blame) names the EA
   properties checkbox. 10027 diagnostic now reads both flags live and
   names the ACTUAL off-switch (toolbar / EA-checkbox / toggled-at-send)
   instead of always blaming the toolbar - same class as the b27
   distance/10027 misdirect fix.
3. A3 (M3): broker-geometry INFO now says "no fixed stops/freeze
   reported (0 pts)" + dynamic caveat when the broker reports 0, instead
   of a bare "0 pts" that read as known-safe.
4. A4 (M3): tick/ask recovery-signal branch now logs an INFO naming the
   tick basis (was silent; only bar-close mode logged, at 1970).
5. A5 (M3): own-chart lock re-assert message now names the unclean-
   shutdown-survivor case, not only parameter-change re-init.
6. A6 PARKED - manual-SL-refused throttle; never observed spamming
   (Jeff 2026-07-21). Re-opens only on real repeat evidence.
No persisted field added => state-file schema / self-test unchanged.

## FINDING (raise with Jeff) - stale broker fact in this manifest
The Environment note above states "Doo Prime XAUUSD.s stops level =
100 pts" as a constant, but the b29 handover empirical ledger records
it as DYNAMIC 20-100 pts intraday (sampled). A3 (above) codifies the
dynamic reality. The "= 100 pts" line should be reworded to "sampled
100 pts; DYNAMIC 20-100 intraday" - not silently changed here because
it underpins sealed b28 deferral evidence (93 < 100). Flagged, pending
Jeff's confirmation of the wording.

## b24 changes (Stage 8 Step 1: manual exit adoption, matrix SEALED)
Design: STAGE8_MATRIX.md (37 rows, sealed 2026-07-16). Summary:
1. SequenceState: manualTP/manualSL persisted (absent-key = 0.0,
   backward compat; self-test extended). 14th save site at adoption.
2. DetectManualExitEdits (pre-substitution, each pass): armed-ticket
   deltas classified - adopt (WARN w/ money impact if exposure-
   increasing, else INFO) / conflict = adopt none + WARN / post-BE
   looser SL refused / trailing skipped (ratchet path owns it).
   Removals never adopted - enforce loop reverts + WARN (both TP+SL).
3. Want-value substitution: owned manual overrides computed before
   ApplyProtectiveEngines; engines still tighten on top. Exceeded-
   close messages name manual vs computed. Re-anchor INFO gated off
   while manual SL owned.
4. Structural TP release (ReleaseManualTP): level add / level close /
   trail-arm, WARN names trigger. Manual SL: NO structural release
   (locked - risk statement + level budget).
5. ReconcileManualExits (end of Reconcile live path): ownership
   continues on agreement; death-window close releases TP only;
   dead-window edits adopted (M7-5); mid-propagation kill completed
   + WARN (M7-7); conflicts drop to computed + WARN (M7-6). Seeds
   lastApplied/armed; one-pass detection skip (Reconcile's verdicts
   propagate without re-classification).
6. Dashboard: TP/SL rows show " [MANUAL]" while owned.

## b25 fix (found live 2026-07-17, Jeff's log - S8-2 regression FAIL)
b24 detection read the EA's OWN stale write after a structural recompute
as a trader edit (cur == lastApplied != new want for one pass) and
adopted its own previous TP: adopt/release oscillation per level add,
TP never recalculating. SL variant latent and worse (no structural
release = stale anchor frozen permanently). Fix: candidate requires
delta from want AND from lastApplied (the discriminator policy A had,
dropped in the b24 rewrite). Matrix row M5-6 added; S8-2 hardened.

## b26 fix (found live 2026-07-17, Jeff's dashboard observation)
Manual substitution was enforcement-path only: dashboard TP/SL rows,
Proj at TP/SL, and LogStructure projected from raw computed while the
broker ran on the manual value (TP row showed computed value wearing
the [MANUAL] tag; projection frozen). Fix: same substitution at both
display call sites; zero money-path changes. Matrix M2-7, checklist
S8-25 added. Pre-existing (NOT b26, parked as fold-in candidate):
Proj at SL under BE projects from the computed anchor, not the BE
floor - predates Stage 8, raise for a display decision separately.

## b27 changes (found live 2026-07-17, BE + pending sessions)
1. D2 lock enforced at arm: manual SL cleared with INFO at BE trigger
   ("BE floor owns; tighter edit can re-own, M6-1") and at trail
   activation ("ratchet owns; tighter edit becomes floor"). b26 left
   manualSL set after arm - no money impact (floor logic superseded
   it) but dashboard showed [MANUAL] on an engine-owned SL and fed
   defect 2.
2. Exceeded-close labels derive from the value's ACTUAL source
   (manual / BE floor / trail ratchet / computed by comparison, not
   manualSL>0). b26 labeled a BE-floor backstop close "manual (trader
   risk cap)" - wrong provenance in a money log line.
3. LogBrokerExitGeometry() at init (both paths, incl CONFIG-BLOCKED):
   one-shot INFO stops/freeze levels + config guidance WARNs when BE
   (Trigger-Offset < broker min: stop born unplaceable, backstop
   closes at BE price but NOT broker-held/kill-proof) or Trail
   (Distance < broker min: chronic deferral) geometry cannot place.
   Jeff's request: broker constraints guide config, not surprise
   mid-trade. Plus WARN when AutoTrading toolbar is OFF at init.
4. P6 pending-reject WARN is retcode-aware. Found live: 10027
   (AutoTrading off, toolbar) printed the fixed "broker min distance"
   suffix and sent Jeff hunting a distance problem that pre-check had
   already passed (line 262-344 pts out). 10027/10026/10017 now name
   the real cause; 10015/10016 carry the distance context.
   (Also confirmed from code: NO auto-retry on pendings - the 3 rapid
   sends were 3 confirm clicks; success clears armed state so
   double-placement is not possible.)

## Session 2026-07-18 (weekend, BTCUST surface)
Locked: seal-evidence amendment - symbol-AGNOSTIC branches accept
BTCUST demo evidence (kill battery S8-23/S8-24, S8-12/13/14, 10027);
symbol-SENSITIVE items (money-impact arithmetic, M6-1, S8-17, SELL
lap) remain XAUUSD.s-only. Rationale: TRTM is multi-instrument by
design; persistence/reconcile paths have no symbol math. Rejected:
BTC-for-everything.
S8-14 manual conflict window: attempted x3, best separation 525ms
(adjacent passes) - NOT reproducible manually. Accepted per procedure;
conflict branch evidence = K4 (M7-6 reconcile path), now REQUIRED.
Sealed this session: S8-23 (terminal-restart half, K0), S8-24a (K1,
lock re-assert proves hard kill vs K0's clean release). Bonus: 6-flip
S8-9 chain + fat-finger 650008.00 adoption (58,585,827-pt WARN exact)
recorded as live evidence attached to the rev-2 locked rationale.
BTCUST empirical: stops/freeze 0 pts at init; spread ~1400-1418 pts;
tether tick-value factor ~0.9991 on all money projections; MaxSpread
80 (gold-tuned) forfeited L2 until raised (forfeit WARNs correct).

## b29 changes (Stage 9 Step 1: tester interactive mode, matrix SEALED)
Design: STAGE9_MATRIX.md (21 rows, 5 groups, sealed 2026-07-20).
Purpose: make the SHIPPING EA interactive in the MT5 visual tester
(chart events never fire there, build 5833) with ZERO live-chart
behavior change. NO money-path changes in this build.
Touch points (+55 lines, all one file; +27 was the code estimate,
overage is inline rationale comments, no extra logic):
1. TP-1 PanelButtonSet create-block: OBJPROP_ZORDER=10 on buttons
   (bg stays 0), unconditional (D1). Only live-visible delta; M4
   proves live clicks unaffected.
2. TP-2 PollTesterButtons(): MQL_TESTER-gated, polls 10 button STATEs
   every tick (D2, no throttle); latched button -> [TESTER] click
   line -> HandlePanelClick (reused verbatim, un-presses internally).
   Two-latched-same-tick dispatch in array order (M2-5).
3. TP-3 OnTick head: poll call placed ABOVE the g_configBlocked
   early-return so a click under config-block still reaches
   HandlePanelClick's own guard (M3-1). Verified 4144 before 4145.
4. TP-4 LogTesterModeOnce(): one-shot [TESTER] init INFO (D3),
   MQL_TESTER-gated, called from BOTH OnInit exit paths (config-
   blocked + normal) so the channel is announced either way.
UNCHANGED (explicit): HandlePanelClick body, OnChartEvent (live event
path byte-identical - regression anchor), all 10 click handlers, ALL
money paths (exits/recovery/adoption/reconcile/BE/trail), state
persistence + self-test (no new persisted field), PanelRefresh value-
update path, all inputs. MQL_TESTER is net-new in the file.
Hygiene: brace delta -1 (unchanged), CRLF clean (0 bare LF), ASCII-
only. Cannot compile MQL5 - compiler output is checklist gate zero.

## b28 fix (found live 2026-07-18, K2 kill test on BTCUST - FAIL)
K2 (S8-24b) FAIL on b27: death-window close released manual TP
correctly (M7-4 WARN), but ReconcileManualExits' M7-5 branch then
re-adopted the SURVIVING ticket's broker TP 64500.00 - the EA's own
pre-kill propagation - as a trader edit, because the release had
already cleared manualTP and the branch lacked the b25 discriminator.
Net: computed 64272.94 never re-asserted; the release WARN's
"re-asserted" claim was false. SL half PASSED (ownership continued).
Root cause: order-of-operations (release clears ownership, then
classification runs against the emptied persisted value). Fix:
capture releasedTP at the release site; M7-5 candidate must differ
from it; suppressed case logs one-shot M7-8 INFO. Nuance mirrors
M5-6: a genuine dead-edit to exactly the old value is reverted once.
Matrix row M7-8 (38 rows); S8-24b hardened. Live-path detection
untouched (b25 discriminator already correct there). Queued
observability items remain queued (fix-only build). FAIL evidence
retained: 23:44:59 log block 2026-07-18, b27.

## Stage 9 Step 1 - SEALED by Jeff 2026-07-20
Tester interactive mode on the SHIPPING EA. All 19 checklist items
PASS. Two environments: LIVE demo (regression) + MT5 visual tester
(GBPAUD.s M15, build 5833). Evidence audited to the cent.

LIVE regression (safety gate - proves zorder change is clean live):
- S9-1 PASS: live init shows NO [TESTER] line (gate holds, MQL_TESTER
  false live). S9-2 PASS: all buttons dispatch via OnChartEvent, NO
  [TESTER] poll line ever (verified absence). S9-3 PASS: object list
  = 0 objects (buttons still HIDDEN, no strays, screenshot). S9-4
  PASS: zorder survived ~3 min refresh churn, all buttons responsive
  first-click (M4-3 clean, no finding).

TESTER items:
- S9-5 PASS: one-shot [TESTER] init INFO, at init not per-tick (x2+
  launches). S9-6 PASS: same line fires from the CONFIG-BLOCKED init
  path too (TP-4 both call sites live).
- S9-7/S9-8 PASS: poll channel dispatches on shipping EA; ALL 10
  buttons have DIRECT [TESTER] poll lines (equivalence not needed) -
  B_BUY/SELL/CLOSE/PBUY/PSELL/PCONF/PCXL/CXLP/BE/TRAIL.
- S9-9 PASS: latch-fires-once, accepted on ~18-click accumulated
  evidence (no double-fire ever). S9-10 PASS by inspection+procedure:
  same-tick two-button contention not manually reproducible (3 tries,
  best 1 tester-sec; mirrors S8-14). Poll loop is for(i=0..9) over a
  static array, no inter-iteration state -> array-order dispatch is a
  structural guarantee. Adjacent-tick sequential (E4 arm-switch)
  directly evidenced.
- S9-11 PASS (the no-silent-path row): under config-block the poll
  reaches HandlePanelClick (loop sits ABOVE the OnTick config-blocked
  return, 4144<4145), refusal logged ONE-SHOT via AlreadyLogged, no
  order, no silent swallow. Repeat clicks still emit the poll line
  (channel never silent) while the refusal is suppressed (one-shot) -
  both observability axes satisfied. S9-12 PASS by composition: true
  mid-run input change is a TESTER LIMITATION (inputs locked per
  pass); block->clean transition proven by blocked-run clean latch
  behavior + clean-run dispatch + g_configBlocked reset at OnInit
  boundary (line 4009, code-confirmed).
- S9-13..S9-19 PASS: full lifecycle via poll. BUY/SELL arm+open
  (signs exact), CLOSE arm+confirm+flat (x2), pending PBUY place+
  confirm+CXLP cancel AND PSELL/PCXL placement-cancel, BE arm+trigger
  (floor = avg + 30 offset exact: 1.88457+30pts=1.88487), trail
  arm+ratchet+exit (activation -100 exact; steps 34pt/11pt >= min 10;
  exit on trailed SL 1.88297, attribution correct). Pending-confirm
  broker-min guard fired correctly (line 1pt from market < 25 min,
  named cause).

TESTER EMPIRICAL FACTS (ledger; terminal is truth):
- GBPAUD.s stops level = 25 pts (tester), confirms prior probe.
- Cross-pair first-trade symbol auto-sync (GBPUSD.s, AUDUSD.s load on
  first GBPAUD position): this is MetaTester's USD-valuation engine
  loading conversion legs, NOT a TRTM behavior (plain tester lines,
  no [TRTM] tag; TRTM only touches _Symbol via the wrapper). Would
  reproduce on b28. Verifiable: USD-quote symbol shows no pop-ups.
- Config-block refusal ("Buttons are config-blocked") is one-shot in
  tester too (AlreadyLogged cfgclick).
- Tester input limits: inputs locked per pass (no mid-run change);
  object drag dead (draggable pending line). WORKAROUND b33: Stage 9
  Step 2 adds tester-only +/- nudge buttons to move the pending line.
- MT5 visual tester has NO in-pass EA restart (observed 2026-07-21,
  Jeff-corrected): no remove/re-attach, no Properties/param-change
  re-init mid-pass. To re-init you must stop and restart the whole pass
  from the beginning. => restart-row tests (e.g. S18) run on a LIVE demo
  chart, where remove/re-add / recompile / param-change fire a real
  OnDeinit->OnInit. (OBSERVED, not assumed.)

## b29-QUEUED observability batch: NOW BUILT as Stage10-b30 (2026-07-21).
Own matrix/checklist (STAGE10_*). All 5 confirmed items (A1-A5) in the
build; A6 parked. Awaiting live+tester verification before seal.

## Stage 8 Step 1 - SEALED by Jeff 2026-07-20
Final market-hours session (XAUUSD.s, demo, logs audited to the cent):
- M6-1 PASS 07:16:42 - post-BE above-floor SL edit 3991.74 (floor
  3991.66, +8 pts) adopted INFO with level-budget note. BE trigger
  3992.36 fired @ 3992.59; floor = avg 3991.36 + 30 pts exact;
  deferred placement (93 pts < 100 min) then applied - acceptable
  per seal criteria.
- S8-17 PASS 16:01:01 - manual TP 4024.59 owned at trail arm ->
  "RELEASED - trailing armed" WARN (M5-3 call site), TP removed same
  pass, supersede INFO for owned SL 4009.46, activation SL
  4021.06 = 4022.56 - 150 exact.
- SELL lap PASS (three sequences 16:02-17:45):
  S8-10(S): tighter-classification SELL sign flip proven (4048.72,
    4040.91 each lower = tighter -> INFO; same branch as
    tighter-vs-computed). Loosen side corroborated: 4050.54 WARN
    $34.64 = 1732 pts x 0.02 exact (M3-2 SELL, gold arithmetic).
  S8-15(S): PASS twice (L2 add 16:17, L3 add 17:42) - release WARN
    names level, computed re-asserted, manual SL untouched in every
    exits-applied line (M5-1(S) + M3-4(S)).
  S8-6(S): PASS 17:44:54 - 3-level seq (0.02/0.02/0.03), TP edited
    on MIDDLE ticket 666655888 (L2), adoption INFO (36 pts closer =
    exposure-decreasing, correct), propagated to L1+L3 within 216ms
    one pass, all 3 carry 4015.70.
- Projection audits exact throughout: 2-level +12.00/-35.76;
  3-level +23.11/-53.19 (proj from manual SL when owned - display
  truth holding); computed TP 4015.34 = simple avg 4018.3433 - 300.
- Bonus evidence: M6-3 ratchet-floor adopt live BOTH directions
  (4021.26 BUY 16:01:12, 4024.36 SELL 16:29:15) - upgrades S8-21
  from equivalence to direct evidence.
- First trail-arm attempt 07:52 was NOT S8-17 evidence (L2 add at
  07:41 had already released the TP via M5-1; M5-3 site never ran) -
  rerun performed; recorded so equivalence is never claimed here.

## Accepted cosmetics (recorded, not churned)
- Benign duplicate "Exits applied" line after stops-level deferral
  retry (same value, no money impact). Seen 16:01:07/16:01:08 (BUY)
  and 16:29:06 (SELL). Display/log ordering quirk only.

## Parked additions 2026-07-20
- Computed-TP anchor: SIMPLE average of entries (code comment lines
  1094-1097 marks simple-vs-lot-weighted as a PENDING decision,
  "implemented to match spec until then"). First unequal-lot live
  evidence today: 0.02/0.02/0.03 -> simple avg 4018.3433 vs weighted
  4018.6414; simple sets TP beyond financial BE+300 when late lots
  are larger (errs profitable). Needs its own Gate 1 when raised -
  money-path change, do not fold in.

## Locked decisions log (additions this session)
2026-07-16 Deferred-TP RE-EXAMINED AND CLOSED, zero code delta:
Choice 1 (bank at market when computed TP already exceeded) STANDS.
b20 race gate made broker-held-TP riding technically trustworthy but
does not change give-back risk; "TP is a MINIMUM acceptable exit"
principle reaffirmed. Alternatives rejected: ride old broker TP
(unbounded give-back, the exact R8 pain), hybrid buffer (complexity
for a guessed input). Jeff confirmed.
2026-07-16 Stage 8 design session, all locked (see STAGE8_MATRIX.md):
no policy selector; removals always reverted; asymmetric manual
lifetime (TP releases on structural events, SL persists); conflict
adopts nothing; engines own once armed; adoption persisted w/ death-
window reconcile rules. Policy A retired with b24.
2026-07-21 Stage 10 observability batch (see STAGE10_MATRIX.md):
D1 Guard-blocked file log = WARN, not INFO. Rejected INFO: splits log
   from the amber dashboard row and understates an operational-
   availability event (EA silently won't enter); the "protective ->
   INFO" rule is about market-risk direction, a different axis. Keying:
   one-shot per reason, re-announce on reason switch, re-arm on clear.
D2 A2 = BOTH touches (init sibling WARN + flag-aware 10027). Rejected
   init-only. SUPERSEDED by D6 (see below) on live evidence.
D6 (2026-07-21, supersedes D2's init-sibling half): DROP the init
   sibling; MQL_TRADE_ALLOWED is proven unreliable at OnInit (true with
   the F7 box off) though correct at TRADE time. Move the cause hint to
   a shared helper called from BOTH send paths (E7 market + P6 pending).
   D2's flag-aware-10027 half stands and is proven (S10-15 PASS); only
   the init-detection premise was wrong.
D3 Cover Guards A/B/C, not A alone. Rejected A-only: B/C share the
   identical dashboard-only block; fixing one leaves a known-identical
   silent path.
D4 A6 (manual-SL-refused throttle) PARKED. Rejected inclusion: no
   observed log spam; a throttle for a theorized repeat violates
   terminal-is-truth. Re-opens only on real repeat evidence.
D5 A3/A4/A5 verified as ONE folded regression row (Jeff). Pure log
   text/emission, money-neutral.
2026-07-21 MARTINGALE COMPOUNDING BASIS - CLOSED, zero code delta.
Jeff's live-raised recursive request WITHDRAWN by Jeff after reviewing
the numeric tradeoff (GATE1_martingale_basis.md). CLOSED-FORM (current)
STANDS as the meaning of the multiplier: level = base * mult^tier,
normalized per level (ComputeLevelLot line 1752/1776; normalizer 1798
round-to-nearest). Confirmed behavior on base 0.01 / mult 1.5 / step 2:
L3-L6 hold at 0.02 (0.0225 rounds down - the "stall"), first step-up at
L7 (0.03375 -> 0.03), then L9 0.05, etc. Jeff verified and accepts the
stall as the honest geometric curve.
  Rejected R-a (deterministic recursive on last-normalized lot): gives
  the climbing 1,1,2,2,3,3 ramp AND stays stateless/restart-safe, but is
  RISK-INCREASING - drifts above mult^n and accelerates (~+33% margin by
  tier2, more at depth). Jeff declined the added risk for no offsetting
  gain; the stall is cosmetic-expectation only, not a math error.
  Rejected R-b (recursive seeded from executed lot): also risk-
  increasing AND breaks statelessness (needs realized last lot ->
  persisted field, uninit-field trap, self-test + backward-compat
  change). No mid-sequence input-adaptation requirement exists to
  justify it.
  Scope untouched by this decision: plain RM_MARTINGALE, RM_MANUAL,
  incremental / deferred-incremental all remain as-is. No matrix, no
  build - nothing was changed.
  RE-OPEN CONDITION: only if a live requirement for a per-tier climbing
  ramp appears; then R-a is the implementation to cost, as a fresh
  Gate 1 with its own matrix and explicit risk-drift acknowledgement.

2026-07-21 STAGE 9 STEP 2 - tester pending-line adjust = NUDGE (Gate 1
locked; matrix pending). Problem: visual tester creates the pending
placement line at ask/bid but chart drag is dead there, so the line
cannot leave the market band and CONFIRM (pollable) always hits the
stops-level refusal - the pending flow is reachable but unusable in
tester. Decision: add two TESTER-ONLY polled buttons (B_PUP/B_PDN) that
shift PLINE OBJPROP_PRICE by +/- InpTesterNudgePts per click; the SEALED
confirm path (ComputeEntryLot, Guard C pre-screen, EntrySLRealizable/
Guard B, stops-level band, place) is read+validated UNCHANGED.
  Rejected OFFSET (declarative input placing the line at ref+/-offset):
  non-interactive (edit input + re-run to change price) and a fixed
  per-run offset is really a Stage 9 Step 3 auto-entry seed - building it
  here duplicates Step 3 and gives no interactive-flow value. Offset held
  in reserve for Step 3.
  Sub-decisions carried into the matrix (seal or correct there):
   - Buttons created + polled in TESTER ONLY (MQL_TESTER-gated), so the
     LIVE panel stays byte-identical (live already has native drag).
   - Step = input InpTesterNudgePts, default 50, clamp >=1.
   - NO band clamp on movement (REVERSED from the Gate 1 brief's clamp
     rec): the line may legitimately sit either side of market (buy-limit
     below / buy-stop above; order type inferred at confirm). Clamping at
     the band would block legitimate cross-market placement. Movement is
     free; CONFIRM remains the sole authority and already refuses+keeps
     the line for re-nudge. Each nudge logs the new line price (INFO;
     placement price, not a live money change).
  NO code yet - matrix must seal first (STAGE9_STEP2_MATRIX.md).
